## Next Steps
When I first came up with the idea of this app. I had some big picture ideas of how this app could evolve with future version updates.
At home I struggle to conceptualize what to eat based on what food I currently have when I haven't planned ahead to make something. 
I thought it would be cool to include Recipes as an entity in this app. With the foundational idea being, based on what food I have in my inventory, what recipes can I make.
Secondly, if I am missing some ingredients from recipes and I want to make a specific recipe, add those items to my grocery list. Whether this is done via API or allowing the user to build
their own recipe database, we'll see, but there is definitely room for further development on this app!
